    <p>My future plans revolve around my passion for UI/UX design and innovation. I am particularly interested in creating seamless and enjoyable user experiences that enhance the way people interact with digital products and services.</p>
    
    <p>Joining the Experience and Product Design course at Singapore Polytechnic is an exciting opportunity for me. It will provide dedicated time and resources to bring my ideas to life. I have been nurturing and documenting these ideas over the years, and I am thrilled to have the chance to explore and develop them further within a supportive and creative environment.</p>
    
    <p>I aspire to become a keynote/logo/brand designer, specializing in crafting impactful visual identities that resonate with audiences. Additionally, I am drawn to roles where I can enhance the customer experience by creating a welcoming and immersive environment. I'm inspired by the specialists at Apple stores who focus on making customers fall in love with the products through a pleasant shopping experience.</p>
    
    <p>While NUS (National University of Singapore) is my top choice for continuing my education, I am also considering overseas opportunities like studying at SCAD (Savannah College of Art and Design). These international experiences would provide a global perspective and enrich my understanding of design and innovation.</p>
